## Installation

There is only one dependency required for the README generator, the command to install it is:
npm install inquirer

## Usage

To run the README generator, you start by using the command "node <file name> (in this case index.js)" You will then be prompted to answer a series of questions, e.g. "What is the title of your project?" or "Please provide a description of your project:"
Upon answering all nine of the prompts your professional README file will be generated.

Here is a link for a recording of me demonstrating how to use the README generator: https://drive.google.com/file/d/13UdcSQP1g3MDDUeQei-tgYLmua46VWAk/view

## Tests

To test the README generator, simply run the program in the terminal (using the command "node index.js"), answer the prompts and your README file should be generated, with "README file created!" also being logged to the console.
